# Elegy

_Elegy is a Neural Networks framework based on Jax and Haiku._ 

Elegy implements the Keras API but makes changes to play better with Jax & Haiku and give more flexibility around losses and metrics (more on this soon). Elegy is still in a very early stage, feel free to test it and send us your feedback!

#### Main Features

* **Familiar**: Elegy should feel very familiar to Keras users.
* **Flexible**: Elegy improves upon the basic Keras API by letting users optionally take more control over the definition of losses and metrics.
* **Easy-to-use**: Elegy maintains all the simplicity and ease of use that Keras brings with it.
* **Compatible**: Elegy strives to be compatible with the rest of the Jax and Haiku ecosystem.

For more information take a look at the [Documentation](https://poets-ai.github.io/elegy).

## Installation

Install Elegy using pip:
```bash
pip install elegy
```

## Quick Start
Elegy greatly simplifies the training of Deep Learning models compared to pure Jax / Haiku where, due to Jax functional nature, users have to do a lot of book keeping around the state of the model. In Elegy just you just have to follow 3 basic steps:

**1.** Define the architecture inside an `elegy.Module`:
```python
class MLP(elegy.Module):
    def call(self, image: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        mlp = hk.Sequential([
            hk.Flatten(),
            hk.Linear(300),
            jax.nn.relu,
            hk.Linear(10),
        ])
        return mlp(image)
```
**2.** Create a `Model` from this module and specify additional things like losses, metrics, optimizers, and callbacks:
```python
model = elegy.Model(
    module=MLP.defer(),
    loss=[
        elegy.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
        elegy.regularizers.GlobalL2(l=1e-5),
    ],
    metrics=elegy.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy.defer(),
    optimizer=optix.rmsprop(1e-3),
)
```
**3.** Train the model using the `fit` method:
```python
model.fit(
    x=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    epochs=100,
    steps_per_epoch=200,
    batch_size=64,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    shuffle=True,
)
```

## Why Jax + Haiku?

**Jax** is a linear algebra library with the perfect recipe:
* Numpy's familiar API
* The speed and hardware support of XLA
* Automatic Differentiation

The awesome thing about Jax that Deep Learning is just a usecase that it happens to excel at but you can use it for most task you would use Numpy for.

On the other hand, **Haiku** is a Neural Networks library built on top of Jax that implements a `Module` system, common Neural Network layers, and even some full architectures. Compared to other Jax-based libraries like Trax or Flax, Haiku is very minimal, polished, well documented, and makes it super easy / clean to implement Deep Learning code! 

We believe that **Elegy** can offer the best experience for coding Deep Learning applications by leveraging the power and familiarity of Jax API, the ease-of-use of Haiku's Module system, and packaging everything on top of a convenient Keras-like API.
