    Returns:
        A callable that waits for the inputs and applies the layers sequentially.

class Sequential(Module):

    Sequentially calls the given list of layers.

    Note that `Sequential` is limited in the range of possible architectures
    it can handle. This is a deliberate design decision; `Sequential` is only
    meant to be used for the simple case of fusing together modules/ops where
    the input of a particular module/op is the output of the previous one.

    Another restriction is that it is not possible to have extra arguments in the
    `call` method that are passed to the constituents of the module - for
    example, if there is a `BatchNorm` module in `Sequential` and the user
    wishes to switch the `training` flag. If this is the desired use case,
    the recommended solution is to subclass `Module` and implement
    `call`:

    ```python
    class CustomModule(elegy.Module):
        def call(self, x, training):
            x = elegy.nn.Conv2D(32, 4, 2)(x)
